\section{Introduction}
 
Human&Computer interactive go game on cell phone is everywhere today. Our project's "bang for the buck" lies in connecting cell phone users to worldwide weichi players on the Internet in mobile manner and getting a good weichi assistantship on mobile device. This could not be achieved previously due to the relative isolation of individule cell phones from 3G resources and their limited computing capability, which could be overcomed by recent  achievements in wide coverage of the wireless network and 3G networks, ability of cell phones to acess Internet, open APIs of cell phone OS, etc.. Our project is on the way to take advantage of these achievements to upgrade cell phones' game playing environment.

Risks might include:
 
a. limited cell phone computing resources;
b. open search algorithm;
c. unfamiliar with KGS server's protocol;
d. unfamiliar with Android development environment.
